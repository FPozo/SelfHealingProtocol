 *  Class for the frames in the network. A frame has only one node (end system) sender and one or multiple (also end   *
 *  systems) receivers. All frames must have a period in nanoseconds and a size in bytes. They may also have a         *
 *  deadline (also in nanoseconds).                                                                                    *
 *  A frame is possible to have and end-to-end delay from the sender to the receiver (different for any if needed).    *
 *  It is possible for a frame to need to start after an specific amount of time since the schedule started.           *
 *  Frames contain a path of links to arrive from the sender to the receiver, if it is none, it means it has not       *
 *  decided yet, and other entity (such as a network or a scheduler) will decide it later.                             *
 *                                                                                                                     *
